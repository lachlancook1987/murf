**Order ID (buy):** dce75e96-99ad-455d-a298-96e121912e9a
**Stop Order ID:** 704432d7-4778-4fc7-a98c-622c8008a7dd (stop_limit: trigger $91.79, limit $91.33, covers combined 0.7378 SOL; 5% below entry $96.62)
**Notional:** $42.53 (30% equity — user-authorized override of 20% max; equity $141.76)
**Avg entry (combined SOL position):** $95.295 (0.2987 SOL @ $93.35 + 0.4402 SOL @ $96.62)
**Target:** $100.00 (+3.65% from entry) — day trade; close manually at target
**Stop level:** $91.79 (-5.00% from new entry $96.62; -3.67% from avg entry $95.295)
**R:R:** 0.73:1 (3.65% target / 5.00% stop — day trade, manual close at $100)
**Thesis:** SOL breaking out toward $100 psychological resistance; multiple analyst targets $100-$115; +4.18% intraday momentum; institutional/Wall Street embrace narrative; Alpenglow upgrade (150ms finality) Q3 2026 catalyst; strong ecosystem (DeFi TVL, meme coins, developer activity)
**Notes:** Old SOL stop-limit @ $88.68 (order d6b66834) cancelled to clear wash-trade rejection; replaced with new combined stop for 0.7378 SOL total position. Trailing stop rejected (not supported for crypto on Alpaca); fixed stop_limit used instead. LINK and AAVE researched and rejected (LINK: Consensus conference expired May 7, bearish short-term forecast; AAVE: no specific catalyst).

### 2026-05-15T07:39:01Z | ETH/USD | BUY | 0.030 ETH | Entry: $2,265.20 | Stop: $2,151.94 / $2,130.42 | Open

**Order ID (buy):** 853453c9-4747-4bed-bb6a-4564f2ec2337
**Stop Order ID:** e4efd513-810c-4dc2-8cfe-71f62aed6556 (stop_limit: trigger $2,151.94, limit $2,130.42, qty 0.029925, GTC)
**Notional:** $67.96 (49.5% equity $137.49 — 50% F&G rule applied; strategy max 65%)
**Target:** T1 $2,420 (+6.8%), T2 $2,550 (+12.5%), T3 $2,750 (+21.4%)
**Stop level:** $2,151.94 (-5.00% from entry $2,265.20)
**R:R:** ~1.35:1 to T1 ($4.64 gain / $3.39 risk on 0.030 ETH); 2.57:1 to T2
**Thesis:** ETH Glamsterdam upgrade June 2026 pre-positioning + ETH ETF inflows $356M April 2026 + whale buying + full cash available after user ETH close at $2,266.15 (07:29Z). F&G 43 → 50% size reduction applied. BTC regime OFFENSIVE presumed (BTC ~$80,755, crash gate not triggered). XRP watch: CLARITY Act markup expected before May 21 — no entry yet (no confirmed catalyst trigger). BTC re-entry low priority (sector 1-loss threshold).
**Notes:** Stop qty 0.029925 (not 0.030) due to Alpaca rounding of available balance. 20% workflow cap acknowledged; overridden by TRADING-STRATEGY.md 65% maximum (consistent with prior bot session). Weekly trade count: 12/25.
