## Week of 2026-05-11

### 2026-05-10T23:49:25Z | SOL/USD | BUY | 0.4402 SOL | Entry: $96.62 | Stop: $91.79 | Open

**Order ID (buy):** dce75e96-99ad-455d-a298-96e121912e9a
**Stop Order ID:** 704432d7-4778-4fc7-a98c-622c8008a7dd (stop_limit: trigger $91.79, limit $91.33, covers combined 0.7378 SOL; 5% below entry $96.62)
**Notional:** $42.53 (30% equity — user-authorized override of 20% max; equity $141.76)
**Avg entry (combined SOL position):** $95.295 (0.2987 SOL @ $93.35 + 0.4402 SOL @ $96.62)
**Target:** $100.00 (+3.65% from entry) — day trade; close manually at target
**Stop level:** $91.79 (-5.00% from new entry $96.62; -3.67% from avg entry $95.295)
**R:R:** 0.73:1 (3.65% target / 5.00% stop — day trade, manual close at $100)
**Thesis:** SOL breaking out toward $100 psychological resistance; multiple analyst targets $100-$115; +4.18% intraday momentum; institutional/Wall Street embrace narrative; Alpenglow upgrade (150ms finality) Q3 2026 catalyst; strong ecosystem (DeFi TVL, meme coins, developer activity)
**Notes:** Old SOL stop-limit @ $88.68 (order d6b66834) cancelled to clear wash-trade rejection; replaced with new combined stop for 0.7378 SOL total position. Trailing stop rejected (not supported for crypto on Alpaca); fixed stop_limit used instead. LINK and AAVE researched and rejected (LINK: Consensus conference expired May 7, bearish short-term forecast; AAVE: no specific catalyst).
